# ✨ Welcome to my profile! ✨

### 24-year old aspiring programmer from Germany!

And this is my little space where I share my software projects and workbench codes in, or where I sometimes work on things with friends.

## How things started...

Back when I was a [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany) "Wikipedia article: German Gymnasium") student in 2016, I first came in contact with the programming language [Java](https://www.java.com/en/ "Java Homepage") during that time and learned the basics of programming, alongside some rudimentary [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language "Wikipedia article: Assembly").

Following with an [apprenticeship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_in_Germany "Wikipedia article: German apprenticeships"), I started in 2022, I gained valuable insights in the active development of software projects in productive environments for the two and half years where I worked for the company, mainly stepping into web developement using an [Angular](https://angular.dev/ "Angular Homepage") front-end accompanied with a back-end in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp "C# Homepage").

Over the years until this day, I spend a good portion of my free time programming as a form self-development, working on little projects that merely serve for testing out what a programming language can do and trying different things out.

## Other stuff I do

Besides programming, activities that dominantly take up my time is drawing and bicycling. Also, I play Volleyball, play video games, have movie or board game nights with friends, create MS Word templates, build LEGO sets.
